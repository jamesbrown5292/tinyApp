# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).



## Final Product

!["Log in page"](https://github.com/jamesbrown5292/tinyApp/blob/master/docs/Log%20in.png)

New users can enter an email and password to access the create and edit URL features.


!["View urls page"](https://github.com/jamesbrown5292/tinyApp/blob/master/docs/My%20urls.png)

In their URL index page, users can see all of their created short URLs. Users can also click the favourite button to highlight their favourite links. Clicking the unfavourite button will undo this change. 


!["Edit url page"](https://github.com/jamesbrown5292/tinyApp/blob/master/docs/Edit%20URL.png)

In the url view page, users can update the longURL that their short URL is assigned to. On this page they can also see a record of the number of individual visits, unique visits, the date and time of the UR's creation and the date and time of each visit.
